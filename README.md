## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C. The game allows you to play against a computer opponent. The board is represented as a 3x3 grid, where two players (the human player and the computer) take turns to place their respective symbols, 'X' and 'O', on the board. The game continues until one player wins by forming a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the board is filled up and the game ends in a draw.

### How to Play:

1. The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid displayed on the screen.
2. The player ('X') and the computer ('O') take turns to make moves.
3. The player is prompted to enter the row and column numbers (both ranging from 1 to 3) to place their symbol on the board. The input coordinates should indicate an empty cell.
4. The computer's move is automatically generated, and it places its symbol in a random available cell.
5. The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
   - The player or the computer forms a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - The board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.
6. After the game ends, the final state of the board is displayed, along with the outcome of the game (player win, computer win, or draw).
7. The player is asked if they want to play again. Enter 'Y' to play again, or 'N' to exit the game.
